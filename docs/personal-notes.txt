Things to find out:
-----------------
* How the hell do the system decide what editor to open a file with.
  "sudo apt-get intsall nvim" f.eks overrides all the other editors.
  seems not easy to configure in a convenient way. 
  f.eks: the csv gets opened in the last program you installed :'-)
* Get non-buggy equalizer to work.
* Github autoclone one-liner seems to only clone the public repos :)


words
----------------
gnu   - recursive acronym "gnu is not unix"
        only unix compatible.
FOSS  - Free or Open Source Software
unix  - Multiplexed Information and 
        Computing Service. Multiplexed
        because of "time-sharing OS"?.
        Some ppl think that unix was orignally
         a play on Multics, i.e “Unics”. Dennis Ritchie
         states this is a myth.
        "UNIX is very simple, it just 
         needs a genius to understand 
         its simplicity" - Dennis Ritchie. 
unics  - Un.iplexed I.nformation and C.omputing 
         S.ervice. it is a pun on Multix.
